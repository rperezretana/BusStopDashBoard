# BusStopDashBoard
Bus Stop that shows the arrival time based on the description of the task.


How to Run it?
3 options:

# 1) Download and run on computer.
    1 - It may require Visual Studio 2019.
    2 - Download the project and open the file "BusSchedulemanager.sln" using VS 2019.
    3 - Press Open in IIS Express. An instance of the application will open in the browser.
    
# 2) Run on deployed version.
I deployed a version for quick access here: http://busstopdashboardrolando.azurewebsites.net/views/index.html

# 3) Deploy directly to Azure if you have a free account.
    Here is an option to deploy the project directly to Azure.
    I recomend this only if you already have a free Azure Account and if you got experience deploying .NET Core Applications, otherwise dont need to bother. It may result easier if you just download it and run it.
    <a href="https://azuredeploy.net/" target="_blank">
        <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
    </a>
    It will open a wizard to deploy to azure, you must have an account, if you dont have one.
